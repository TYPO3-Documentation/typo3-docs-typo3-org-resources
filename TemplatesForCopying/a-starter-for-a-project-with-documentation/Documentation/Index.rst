If you follow the instruction at
http://mbless.de/blog/2015/01/26/sphinx-doc-installation-steps.html
you can render the documentation in TYPO3-style yourself. To do so
go to the *\_make*-folder on the commandline and find out what's possible::

   make

Build html::

   make html

Browse the documentation::

   firefox build/html/Index.html &



Windows

Works in principle in the same way.

Enjoy!
