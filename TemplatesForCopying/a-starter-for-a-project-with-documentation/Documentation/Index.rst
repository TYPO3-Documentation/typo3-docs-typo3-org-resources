.. _Start:

===========================
Title Of Your Documentation
===========================

This single file *Index.rst* is your masterdocument.
That is where your documentation starts.

Simply start writing reStructuredText.

Linux, Mac
==========

If you follow the instruction at
http://mbless.de/blog/2015/01/26/sphinx-doc-installation-steps.html
you can render the documentation in TYPO3-style yourself. To do so
go to the *\_make*-folder on the commandline and find out what's possible::

   make

Build html::

   make html

Browse the documentation::

   firefox build/html/Index.html &



Windows

Works in principle in the same way.

Enjoy!
