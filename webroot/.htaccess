# Redirect links to the Flow manual to the new location
# Take all branches into account (version numbers and "latest" and "stable")
# Also adjust file namings: They changed it from Index.html to index.html.
# The "Index.html" part in the old URLs was optional (so it should be followed by a "?" in the expression below),
# but I didn't get the RedirectMatch to work with (.*)(/Index\.html)?$.
# The segment "Index.html" then gets matched by the ".*" and not by the following "/Index.html".
#
# With version number or "latest":
RedirectMatch ^/flow/TYPO3FlowDocumentation/(latest/|[0-9]\.[0-9]/)(.*)/Index\.html$ http://flowframework.readthedocs.org/en/$1$2/index.html

# If no version or "stable" is in URL (both were the same file), redirect to their "stable" version.
# The most links have _no_ version in them, so the next two rules are the ones to usually kick in:
